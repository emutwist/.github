Hey. We’re **EmuTwist**. A one-person organization “based in North Korea” (lol).  

We do weird shit. Like:  

- Tiny fun websites  
- Random apps and scripts that probably shouldn’t exist  
- ASCII art. Lots of ASCII art.  

Basically, if it’s weird or fun, it belongs here.

## How to check stuff out
  
- Run the OSes or apps if you’re curious  
- Fork, copy, or just laugh at our chaos
